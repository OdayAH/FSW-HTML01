    <h1>My name is Oday</h1>
    <p>I’m a Master’s student in Computer and Communication Engineering with a strong passion for machine learning,
        embedded systems, and cybersecurity. My projects reflect a mix of software and hardware skills — from
        implementing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and TinyML for tactile feedback systems, to optimizing deep
        learning models for FPGA deployment.</p>
    <ul>
        <h2>I have done several projects. You can find my projects listed below</h2>
        <li>Flavorful Minds: A laravel project for my senior project where I integrated API into my website that gives
            food recipes based on certain requirements</li>
        <li>YTripleB Management: Developed a website for a business that helps manage other business financially</li>
        <li>FPGA-Implementation-Aware Neural Architecture Search where I deployed FPGA on a NAS model</li>
    </ul>
